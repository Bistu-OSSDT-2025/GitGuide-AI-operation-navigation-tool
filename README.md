## ? Introduction

GitGuide-AI Operation Navigation Tool is an intelligent assistant designed to help users navigate web pages via natural language commands. Users can issue simple instructions like "Go to section 3", and the system automatically jumps to that part of the page.

This tool is especially useful for users who frequently visit structured web applications and want to simplify their daily workflow.

## ?? Core Features

- ? **Natural language jump instructions**: Use text commands to jump to specific sections of a web page.
- ? **HTML structure analysis**: Parses the DOM from webpage source code.
- ? **Python automation**: Automatically generates scripts to perform actions based on analysis.
- ? **Custom web storage**: Users can save their frequently used pages for future automation.

## ? How It Works

1. User provides a web page with source code access.
2. Tool analyzes the DOM structure.
3. User issues a command (e.g., "Open section 3").
4. Python script is generated or executed to scroll/jump/click accordingly.

## ? Goal

To simplify the interaction process for users on complex web platforms by automating routine jumps and actions with minimal input.

## ? Tech Stack

- Python
- DOM Parsing (e.g., BeautifulSoup, lxml)
